    "In this blog post I will talk about:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - How the Bayesian Revolution in many scientific disciplines is hindered by poor usability of current Probabilistic Programming languages.\n",
    "  - A gentle introduction to Bayesian linear regression and how it differs from the frequentist approach.\n",
    "  - A preview of [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/tree/pymc3) (currently in alpha) and its new GLM submodule I wrote to allow creation and estimation of Bayesian GLMs as easy as frequentist GLMs in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ready? Lets get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a huge paradigm shift underway in many scientific disciplines: The Bayesian Revolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the theoretical benefits of Bayesian over Frequentist stats have been discussed at length elsewhere (see *Further Reading* below), there is a major obstacle that hinders wider adoption -- *usability* (this is one of the reasons DARPA wrote out a huge grant to [improve Probabilistic Programming](http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/Probabilistic_Programming_for_Advanced_Machine_Learning_%28PPAML%29.aspx)). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is mildly ironic because the beauty of Bayesian statistics is their generality. Frequentist stats have a bazillion different tests for every different scenario. In Bayesian land you define your model exactly as you think is appropriate and hit the *Inference Button(TM)* (i.e. running the magical MCMC sampling algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet when I ask my colleagues why they use frequentist stats (even though they would like to use Bayesian stats) the answer is that software packages like SPSS or R make it very easy to run all those individuals tests with a single command (and more often then not, they don't know the exact model and inference method being used).\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are great Bayesian software packages like [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/), [BUGS](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/), [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and [PyMC](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/), they are written for Bayesians statisticians who know very well what model they want to build. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, [\"the vast majority of statistical analysis is not performed by statisticians\"](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/06/14/the-vast-majority-of-statistical-analysis-is-not-performed-by-statisticians/) -- so what we really need are tools for *scientists* and not for statisticians.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interest of putting my code where my mouth is I wrote a submodule for the upcoming [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/tree/pymc3) that makes construction of Bayesian Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) as easy as Frequentist ones in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "While future blog posts will explore more complex models, I will start here with the simplest GLM -- linear regression.\n",
    "In general, frequentists think about Linear Regression as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y = X\\beta + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y$ is the output we want to predict (or *dependent* variable), $X$ is our predictor (or *independent* variable), and $\\beta$ are the coefficients (or parameters) of the model we want to estimate. $\\epsilon$ is an error term which is assumed to be normally distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use Ordinary Least Squares or Maximum Likelihood to find the best fitting $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic Reformulation\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesians take a probabilistic view of the world and express this model in terms of probability distributions. Our above linear regression can be rewritten to yield:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(X \\beta, \\sigma^2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, we view $Y$ as a random variable (or random vector) of which each element (data point) is distributed according to a Normal distribution. The mean of this normal distribution is provided by our linear predictor with variance $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is essentially the same model, there are two critical advantages of Bayesian estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Priors: We can quantify any prior knowledge we might have by placing priors on the paramters. For example, if we think that $\\sigma$ is likely to be small we would choose a prior with more probability mass on low values.\n",
    " - Quantifying uncertainty: We do not get a single estimate of $\\beta$ as above but instead a complete posterior distribution about how likely different values of $\\beta$ are. For example, with few data points our uncertainty in $\\beta$ will be very high and we'd be getting very wide posteriors."
